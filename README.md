# Girraphic-MarathonResults

Girraphic set this challenge. I successfully accomplished the following tasks:
1. Import data from a JSON file using the asyc fetch function.
2. Developed two distinct tables for easier comprehension and better graphical display of data.
3. Created the tables using JSON file data in such a way that if the athletes/tables change in the future, the tables will be updated automatically.
4. Added sorting capability, allowing users to arrange the table by Rank/Bib.
5. Finally, the export CSV button was included, allowing users to download the tables as formatted CSV files with the title race-results.
Github was used to host the entire application.
7. During the process, I used the following languages: HTML, CSS, Js, JQuery, and NPMpackage.

Overall, the task was challenging, but I really loved the process of importing data and creating tables. The challenges allowed me to put my knowledge and talents to the test, which made me very delighted since I was able to complete the work entirely with all of the functions.
