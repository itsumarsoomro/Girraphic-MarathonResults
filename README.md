This challenge was given by Girraphic. In this I have completed following things sucessfully:
1. Import data from JSON file using asyc fetch function.
2. Created two different tables for easy understanding and better grapphical representation of data.
3. Populated the tables from JSON file data in a way that in future if the atheletes/table changes the tables will be updated automatically.
4. Added the sorting functionality which will allow the users to sort asec/desc the table by Rank/Bib.
5. Lastly added the export CSV button which allow the users to download the tables in formated CSV files with the title of race-results.
6. Hosted the whole application using Github.
7. In whole process I have utilized following languages: HTML, CSS, Js, JQuery, and NPM package.

Overall the task was challneging but I really enjoyed the task of importing data and populating data in tables. The tasks allowed me to test my knowledge and skills because of that I was really happy as I get to finish task completely with all the functionalities.
